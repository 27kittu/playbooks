    - file_name : logger
  tasks:
    - name: Creating an empty file in all servers using vars
      file:
        path: "/home/ubuntu/{{file_name}}"
        mode: 0755
        owner: ubuntu
        group: ubuntu
        state: touch
    - name: Adding content based on the servers type using vars.
      vars: 
      copy: 
        dest: /home/ubuntu/{{file_name}}
        content: | 
          This is to check if the vars is working or not
          This I want to use them in real tasks to make my work easier
